## Object Categories

ES6规范清晰地定义了每一个对象的种类。

* 普通对象_Ordinary objects_
  * Have all the default internal behaviors for objects in JavaScript.
* 特异对象_Exotic objects_
  * Have internal behavior that differs from the default in some way.
* 标准对象_Standard objects_
  * Are those defined by ECMAScript 6, such as`Array`,`Date`, and so on. Standard objects may be ordinary or exotic.
* 内建对象_Built-in objects_
  * Are present in a JavaScript execution environment when a script begins to execute. All standard objects are built-in objects.
